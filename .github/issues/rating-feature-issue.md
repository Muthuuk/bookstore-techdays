## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe

A lot of the users have said that there's no clear way to distinguish the quality of the books in our portal.

## Describe the solution you'd like

I was thinking we should have a rating feature or something similar to that to allow users to quickly pick up most highest rated books from the other users.

## Describe alternatives you've considered

Support review submissions. Initially it should be sufficient if we allow users to just provide a rating between one and five stars.

## Additional context

With the UX team we cracked something up in a few minutes, let me know what you think and we can go into more detail if you'd like to:
